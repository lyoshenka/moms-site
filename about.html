    <p>
      I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker who has been practicing for 14+ years and specializes in improving the psychological health of
      individuals and families. My work focuses on individuals, couples, and children and their parents/caretakers.
    </p>
    <p>
      My approach to therapy combines my characteristics as an individual – compassionate, charismatic, non-judgmental – with years of
      experience, an effective teaching style, and expertise in a variety of professional methodologies. I work with clients of all ages and
      provide significant relief and assistance. In my practice, I draw on years of education, my training under highly-qualified professionals,
      and my own practical experience in mental health clinics, private offices, and early intervention centers.

      Currently, I work in my private practice in two locations – Brooklyn, NY and Wayne, NJ. I also do individual in-home consultations and
      treatment for children under the age of three and skills training for their parents using the DIR Floortime method. In addition, I
      teach DIR Floortime classes (on line and in person) and lead parenting skills groups and workshops.

    <h3>Approach</h3>

  <div class="column eight">
    <p>
      My approach to therapy combines my characteristics as an individual – compassionate, charismatic, non-judgmental – with years of
      experience, an effective teaching style, and expertise in a variety of professional methodologies. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I work with clients of all ages and
      provide significant relief and assistance. In my practice, I draw on years of education, my training under highly-qualified professionals,
      and my own practical experience in mental health clinics, private offices, and early intervention centers.

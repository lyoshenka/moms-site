    <h3>Children and Teenagers</h3>
    <p>
      A lot is expected of children in our rapidly changing world.  According to a number of research studies, kids come into this world with individual differences in physical and emotional make up. Some children, for example, just do not feel comfortable, and so they tend to be fussy, irritable, negative, or withdrawn. Things might be too quick or too slow for them, too quiet or too loud, frightening or boring. Children vary considerably in the ways they experience events around them and how they respond to the world.  For each unique pattern, however, we can create experiences that promote balanced development and flexibility.

    <h4>My approach</h4>
    <p>
      Drawing on my educational, practical and personal background, I concentrate my work on learning each child’s unique developmental strengths and difficulties. Using the DIR model as basic approach, I develop an individualized, attentive, respectful, and supportive relationship with the child and carefully choose techniques that would be helpful for each individual child. I incorporate play-therapy, Floortime modality, art, behavioral techniques and relaxation exercises into my work. This relationship-orientated approach to the therapy enables the child to learn the skills necessary to confidently and meaningfully interact with others, while maintaining a strong sense of self. Depending on the situation, the therapy work can be structured mostly with the child or evenly designed to include both - child and parent(s)/caregiver. Parenting support and education is also a significant part of my work with every child.

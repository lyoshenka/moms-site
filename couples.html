    <h3>Couples</h3>

      NEED INTRO
    </p>

    <h4>My approach</h4>
    <p>
      By creating a safe, non-judgemental space, I am able to play the role of the objective mediator in a relationship. My work places the individual in the context of the relationship, in order to assist each person to maintain their sense of identity, while nurturing a more fulfilling future together. I focus on analyzing how the couple interacts with each other, seeking insight into the causes of conflict based on behaviors, expectations, and feelings. By determining shared goals, such as overcoming various life challenges, I am able to facilitate healthy interactions and assist couples to develop more satisfying relationships. In my practice, I work with people of different ages, cultural backgrounds, sexual orientations, and life stages.

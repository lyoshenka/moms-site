      At different stages of our lives we happened to need somebody who can listen to what we have

      to say, pay attention to our needs, make an objective observation and provide us with support,

      encouragement and motivation to change things for the better

      In my practice I work with people of different ages, cultural backgrounds, goals and life stages.

      I help small children to learn self-control and to express themselves in appropriate acceptable ways.

      I help teenagers  to explore and establish their unique personality and path into the future as well as to relate to others with respect to self.

      I assist couples in improving their communication with each other and in their overcoming various life challenges.

      I assist parents to improve the understanding of their child and to develop positive, supportive and creative ways in bringing up their great kids to the fullest of their ability

      I assist adults in going through different  stages of their lives, adjusting to changes effectively, being able to find balance, motivation, positive energy and support

      I have knowledge and experience, care and compassion, a warm smile and an efficient teaching style.

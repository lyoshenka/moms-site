    <h3>Parents and Caretakers</h3>
    <p>
      Using similar relationship – based approach with respect for individual personality, family structure and cultural background, I assist the parents in developing deeper understanding of their child’s unique strengths and difficulties. I support and assist the development of parenting skills that empower parents and caretakers to strengthen their relationship with their child and support the child’s development.

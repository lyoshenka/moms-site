    <h3>Adults</h3>
    <p>
      At different stages of our lives we find that we need somebody who can listen to what we have to say, pay attention to our needs, and make objective observations. Sometimes we encounter situations that make us feel uncomfortable or challenged, such as financial troubles or the death of a loved one. It is important to develop skills and strategies to be able to manage the situation and to cope with the emotional strain that it adds to our daily lives. Regaining a sense of control can be critical to stabilizing ourselves.

    <h4>My approach</h4>
    <p>
      My approach focuses on providing supportive and safe environment for the person to feel able to share the problems and develop trust. I assist in developing motivation for change.
    </p>
    <p>
      By providing supportive person-oriented reflection and structure, I am able to empower my patients and help them in learning new skills needed for their present life situation and appropriate adjustment to lifeâ€™s challenges. A compassionate, fully present and attentive existential approach to each individual enables me to provide work towards changing a challenge into a healing and transformational process. In my practice, I work with people of different ages, cultural backgrounds, sexual orientations, and life stages.
